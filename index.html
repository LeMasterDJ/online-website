      Being just the start of a career in discovery and discipline, compiling research is key.
      Have you heard of structural biology or know what a structural study is?
      What about pathologyâ€”investigating what disease is and how it develops?

      Every domain of life no matter how specialized in quantity is comprised of 4 classes of biomolecules!
      In that way, an active pursuit in wondering how things work together accompanies the very emergent behaviors found in biology.

      The cool-looking thing above? The apoptosome, a cell particle for triggering apoptosis; programmed cell death.
